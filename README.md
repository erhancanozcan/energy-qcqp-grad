* [A Stackelberg Game to Control the Overall Load Consumption of a Residential Neighborhood](https://pages.github.com/)


This paper proposes a demand response program with dynamic pricing to control the overall load consumption of a residential neighborhood. The complexity of the proposed problem grows as the number of participating homes increases. To be able to solve the proposed problem efficiently, we develop a gradient-based distributed optimization framework. We show the benefits of utilizing our optimization approach over solving the centralized problem using a commercial solver by conducting various experiments in a simulated environment.

Please consider citing our paper as follows:

```
``` 

While the first command below can be used to solve the centralized Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program, the second command utilizes the proposed gradient-based optimization framework to solve the problem in a distributed way. Both commands require Gurobi to be installed. 


```
nohup python -u -m energy.code.qcqp_gradient --s_effect 1 \
        --num_houses 50 --batch_size 25 --seed 0  \
        --timelimit 900 \
        --lr 1e-1 --lr_update_rule 5 --num_epochs 5 \
